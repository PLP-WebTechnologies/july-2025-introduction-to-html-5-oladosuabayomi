      <h1>The Power of Clean Energy: A Beginner’s Guide to Solar Power</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Welcome to your first step into the world of clean, renewable energy. In
        this beginner’s guide, you’ll learn how solar power works, why it
        matters, and how you can start your journey toward a more sustainable
        future.

        <h2>Why Solar Power Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Climate change and rising energy costs have made clean energy
          solutions more important than ever. Solar power offers a renewable,
          abundant, and eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels. By using
          energy from the sun, we reduce our carbon footprint and build a
          healthier planet for future generations.

      <section id="how">
        <h2>How Does Solar Power Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Solar panels, made of photovoltaic (PV) cells, absorb sunlight and
          convert it into electricity. This energy is then passed through an
          inverter, turning it into usable power for your home or business.
          Excess energy can be stored in batteries or returned to the grid,
          depending on your system setup.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Is solar power expensive?</h3>
        <p>
          While the upfront cost may seem high, many homeowners recover their
          investment within a few years through energy savings and government
          incentives.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What happens at night or on cloudy days?</h3>
        <p>
          Solar panels don’t produce energy at night, but battery systems and
          net metering allow you to use stored or grid power when needed.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Can I use solar power if I rent?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes! Portable solar units and community solar programs are designed
          for renters who want access to clean energy.
